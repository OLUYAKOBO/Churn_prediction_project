**Churn Prediction Project**

**Overview**

Welcome to my Churn Prediction Project! This repository showcases my work on predicting customer churn using machine learning. 
The project aims to help businesses identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to enhance customer retention.
Through detailed data analysis and modeling, we provide actionable insights into the factors contributing to churn.

**Project Highlights**

* **Data Analysis**: Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and correlations related to customer churn.
* **Feature Engineering**: Developed innovative features that capture customer behavior and demographic information to enhance model accuracy.
* **Modeling**: Experimented with various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, to find the most effective model.
* **Evaluation**: Utilized key metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC to rigorously evaluate model performance.
* **Interpretation**: Offered a detailed interpretation of model results, highlighting the most influential factors driving customer churn.
* **Model Deployment**: The model was further deployed into a web application to make it user-friendly.

**Dataset**

The dataset comprises customer details, including demographic information, number of products bought, and credit card status.
It serves as the foundation for training and validating the churn prediction models.

**Results**

The analysis revealed that credit card status and tenure are significant predictors of customer churn. 
The best-performing model achieved a high AUC-ROC score, indicating strong predictive capability.
For a deeper dive into the findings and methodology, refer to the detailed report available in the repository.
The model was deployed in a web application, in order to make it user-friendly.
